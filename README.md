      Efficiently sort a stack using a limited set of operations.

____________________________________________________________________________

Description

The push_swap project is part of the 42 School curriculum. The objective is to sort a stack of integers in ascending order using a limited set of operations and the fewest possible moves. The project requires designing an efficient sorting algorithm and implementing it while adhering to strict coding standards.

Operations

The allowed operations are:
	•	sa: Swap the first two elements of stack a.
	•	sb: Swap the first two elements of stack b.
	•	ss: Perform sa and sb simultaneously.
	•	pa: Push the top element of stack b onto stack a.
	•	pb: Push the top element of stack a onto stack b.
	•	ra: Rotate stack a (first element becomes last).
	•	rb: Rotate stack b.
	•	rr: Perform ra and rb simultaneously.
	•	rra: Reverse rotate stack a (last element becomes first).
	•	rrb: Reverse rotate stack b.
	•	rrr: Perform rra and rrb simultaneously.
